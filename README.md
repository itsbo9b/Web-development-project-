# 🎓 Registration System Web Application

This is a full-stack web application that simulates a university registration system with multi-role access, authentication, and statistical data visualization. It uses modern web technologies such as **React**, **Next.js**, and **Prisma ORM**, alongside **MySQL** as the relational database.

## 📋 Project Overview

The application provides functionality for three user roles:

- 👩‍💼 **Admin**: Manages users and system data.  
- 👨‍🏫 **Instructor**: Manages courses and views student-related information.  
- 👨‍🎓 **Student**: Registers for courses and views personal academic data.

The project integrates both a modern component-based frontend and a classic static frontend:

- 📊 The **statistics page** is built using **React**, **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **CSS**.  
- 🖥️ The main **registration interface** is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React & Next.js  
- Prisma ORM  
- MySQL  
- JWT & Cookie-based Authentication  
- GitHub OAuth (Third-party Authentication Provider)  

## 🚀 Core Features

  - JWT tokens stored in **HTTP-only cookies** for secure session management.  
  - Optional login via **GitHub OAuth** as a third-party provider.  
- 🗄️ **Database Integration**:  
  - Uses **MySQL** with **Prisma ORM** for type-safe, efficient queries.  
- 🖥️ **Registration Interface**:  
  - Built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to simulate basic frontend design and logic.
